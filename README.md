# Category Blocking Foundry app

This Category Blocking Foundry app provides a comprehensive URL filtering solution that simplifies firewall rule management through custom categories and automated rule deployment. Built on CrowdStrike's Foundry platform, this application streamlines URL blocking workflows while providing valuable insights into blocking patterns.

## Description

The Category Blocking app allows you to:

- Create and manage custom categories of domains for blocking
- Deploy firewall rules to block categories of domains across host groups
- Import URL categories from CSV files
- Generate analytics on domain blocking patterns

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.14+ (needed if modifying the app's functions). See [Python For Beginners](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) for installation instructions.
* Node.js (needed for React JS development).
* npm 9+ or Yarn (needed for managing UI dependencies). See https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started for installation instructions.
* FalconPy SDK (for CrowdStrike API integration). Install with pip install crowdstrike-falconpy

## About this app

This application demonstrates advanced usage of Functions, Collections and UI Experience in Falcon Foundry, implementing several key capabilities for URL filtering and firewall management:

### Key Components

1. **Python functions with multiple handlers:**
   - **urlblock**: Fetches host groups information
   - **create-rule**: Creates a firewall policy and rule group that block the selected categories
   - **list-policies**: Lists the policies created by the app
   - **update-policy**: Replaces a policy's categories and whitelist
   - **delete-policy**: Deletes a policy, its rule group and its stored relationships
   - **simulate-policy**: Checks whether a domain would be blocked by any category
   - **check-enforcement** / **health-check**: Verify that policies are enabled and enforcing
   - **domain-analytics**: Generates domain analytics information
   - **import-csv**: Transforms category domain CSV into collections
   - **list-categories**: Lists available categories
   - **search-categories**: Searches for specific categories
   - **manage-category**: Creates or updates categories

2. **Collections for data storage:**
   - **domain**: Stores URLs and category mappings
   - **relationship**: Stores relationship information about host groups, rule groups, and categories

3. **UI Pages with React components:**
   - **Category Blocking Policy**: Main interface for creating firewall rules
   - **Custom Categories**: Management of domain categories
   - **Domain Analytics**: Visualization of domain data
   - **Firewall Rules**: Management of the policies created by the app

### Directory structure
- **collections**: Schemas for domain and relationship collections
- **ui/pages/urlblocking**: React-based frontend application
- **functions/urlblock**: Python backend handlers

## Using the App

### Creating URL Categories
1. Navigate to the **Custom Categories** page
2. Use "Import CSV" to import from a CSV file, or manually add categories
3. View and manage your categories from this interface

### Creating Blocking Rules
1. Navigate to the **Category Blocking Policy** page
2. Enter a policy name and select a host group
3. Select the categories you want to block
4. Click "Preview Domains" to see what will be blocked
5. Click "Create blocking rule" to deploy the rule

### Viewing Analytics
1. Navigate to the **Domain Analytics** page
2. View tables and statistics about blocked domains
3. Analyze patterns and effectiveness of your blocking rules

### Managing Policies
1. Navigate to the **Firewall Rules** page
2. Edit a policy's categories and whitelist, or delete it
3. The replacement policy is created before the old one is removed, so hosts stay protected during an update
